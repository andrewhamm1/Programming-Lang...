The grocer app was created to help[ consumers find an item and it's price inside a grocery store. This code is not perfect and could still use so e work. I added it to my repository being it's one of my hardest projects to date and I am proud of where I came from. 
A few functions are still not working right and need to be reworked to function correctly. 
A list of inventory was given to go with it to help enhance the experience of using the app. 
There are some small sections where I needed to add inline comments and debug my code again. 
Any help from collaborators would definitely be helpful and considered. # Programming-Lang...
